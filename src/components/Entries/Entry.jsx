import React from 'react'


// shout to Triana and Simon from June. I totally forgot about the possibility of an Entry component. This goes to show that good planning practices are critical to successful and complete development. I need to start doing more organizing and planning ahead of these projects.
export default function Entry() {
    return (
        <div>
            
        </div>
    )
}
